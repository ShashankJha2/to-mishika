        As Christmas draws closer, I find myself realizing that all I truly want this year is you and your kind, beautiful soul. 
        You’re everything to me—caring, loyal, incredibly smart, and so sweet it makes my heart melt. 
        You light up every moment we share, and I love everything about you, from your radiant smile to your thoughtful nature. 
        You’re the best gift I could ever ask for, and nothing could compare to having you in my life. 
        <br><br>
        I love you endlessly. ❤️
